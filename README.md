# Dessins REU summer project

Hello! This repo is for for my REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) for Mathematics at the University of Michigan. There were two informal phases of the REU with the first being of understanding the Uniformization theorem and aspects of algebraic topology, complex analysis that was used in our exploration of Dessins in the second phase. You will find literature documented across each of the phases (there may still be some overlap between the two) that I had read and referenced for my project. I had taken notes in LaTeX across the entire REU project and have included them here. See below for more details. Here is a link to my paper for the REU: 

## Math REU notes comments:
These notes were created for my understanding of certain concepts during my Math REU at the University of Michigan. The final REU paper that I presented references the notes here in case the paper was unable to investigate a topic fully. There may be aspects of the notes that are left incomplete; most notes are cited from their original sources so that the reader may visit them for a more in-depth explanation. Please do email <drimikr@umich.edu> if any facts, theorems etc. are incorrectly stated! Thank you.

### Outline of Math REU notes
1. Overview of Riemann Surfaces, Stereographic projection, key terms of function types
2. Homotopy relation, Fundamental group, Introduction to Category Theory
3. Covering maps, universal covers + fundamental group
4. Examples of universal covers, deck transformations
5. Few basic notions of complex analysis
6. Introduction to monodromy + clarifications covering spaces
7. Belyi maps, Dessins with cartographic group, Introduction to Galois Theory
8. Hypergeometric functions, Fuchsian ODEs, monodromy representation

There may be some overlap between sections as well.
