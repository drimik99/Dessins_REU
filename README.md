# Dessins REU summer project

Hello! This repo is for for my REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) for Mathematics at the University of Michigan. There were two informal phases of the REU with the first being of understanding the Uniformization theorem and aspects of algebraic topology, complex analysis that was used in our exploration of Dessins in the second phase. Literature is documented for each of the phases that I referenced as well as a collection of my final REU notes that I had taken across the project on the material and my final REU paper linked here.  

For the Math REU notes:
These notes were created for my understanding of certain concepts during my Math REU at the University of Michigan. The final REU paper that I presented references the notes here in case the paper was unable to investigate a topic fully. There may be aspects of the notes that are left incomplete; most notes are cited from their original sources so that the reader may visit them for a more in-depth explanation. Please do email <drimikr@umich.edu> if any facts, theorems etc. are incorrectly stated! Thank you.
